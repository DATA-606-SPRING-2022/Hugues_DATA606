# Project Proposal : The influence of travel restrictions on COVID

## Introduction 

Since March 2020, COVID-19 was declared as a global pandemic. As of today, the COVID-19 infections are over 400 millions cases, and the death cases approches near 8 millions worldwide. Several countries have imposed travel restrictions in order to minimize the coronavirus disease infections.There was a period where some countries have suspended flights, but later after the lift of lockdowns, traveling has continued under certain restrictions to reduce the virus transmission. Major health organizations have taken some measures to prevent the spread of the virus, such as mandatory vaccines, negative testing results and masks wearing required for all the passengers. To date, there have been over 10 millions vaccines doses successfully administred to the population worldwide.

My goal is to perform an analysis of the influence of travel restrictions on Coronavirus disease
by looking the correlation of traveling restrictions relative to the number of COVID infections, deaths, recovery cases.

## Hypothesis / Research Questions

1. Have travel restrictions been effective in preventing COVID-19?
2. Have vaccinations among the travelers played a significant roles in reducing the virus transmission 
3. Has travel bans for some countries influenced significantly COVID-19 infections and deaths?

## Unit of Analysis

My unit of analysis will primarly focus on domestic travels in the US, and then I will explore international travels from other countries outside of the US. Therefore, I will be collecting the datasets from the reliable sources like Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), John Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE), and World Health Organization (WHO) for global COVID-19 data as well as traveling datasets from The Humanitarian Data Exchange data repositories. 

## Datasets

## Techniques/models to be used
I plan to develop visualizations that show the relationships with each of the travel restrictions and number of COVID-19 infections, deaths, recovery cases. I will implement some form of machine learning unsupervised models like Clustering to group data points that share same characteristics related to COVID-19 cases attributes.
