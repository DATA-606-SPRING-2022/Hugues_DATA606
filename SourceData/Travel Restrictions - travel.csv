*International Restrictions: <br>
*Entry to Australia: For full details on entering Australia, please refer to the Australian Government <a href=""https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/coming-australia"">Department of Home Affairs website </a>.
Entry to Australia is only available if you are exempt or have been granted an individual exemption. Exempt categories include Australian citizens, permanent residents of Australia, immediate family members of Australian citizens or permanent residents, and (from 15 December) fully vaccinated holders of eligible visas. In some cases an individual exemption may be required. A full explanation of exemptions, including how to apply, can be found on the <a href=""https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/travel-restrictions"">Department of Home Affairs website</a>.
•        As of 1 November 2021, ‘immediate family member’ also includes the parents of adult Australian citizens and permanent residents <br>
From 15 December 2021, fully vaccinated holders of eligible visas will be able to enter Australia without obtaining an individual exemption. Details can be found on the <a href=""https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/vaccinated-travellers#toc-8"">Department of Home Affairs website</a> 
•        Travellers who meet exemption criteria or have a compassionate or compelling reason to enter Australia need to apply to the Australian authorities for an exemption <br>
You should <a href=""https://www.health.gov.au/about-us/contact-us/local-state-and-territory-health-departments"">check requirements for the state or territory</a> in which you will arrive.<br>
A negative COVID-19 PCR test result is required for travelling to, or transiting through, Australia. Unless you are travelling on a quarantine-free flight from New Zealand, evidence of a negative COVID-19 test taken within 72 hours of your scheduled departure must be provided to your airline on check in. <br>
You are also required to complete an <a href=""https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/australia-travel-declaration"">Australia Travel Declaration (ATD)< /a> at least 72 hours before departure. The ATD includes a declaration regarding your vaccination status and you will be asked to upload your vaccination certificate. If you are not vaccinated, you may require an exemption to enter Australia. Border rules, including eligibility criteria, can change quickly. Travellers should prepare for disruptions to their plans. <br>
To enter Australia you must hold a valid visa. See ‘Visas during COVID-19’ below for more information. <br>
*Quarantine requirements: Each state and territory is responsible for determining and managing quarantine requirements. You should check <a href=""https://www.australia.gov.au/states"">requirements for the state or territory</a>  in which you will arrive. If you are a fully vaccinated traveller, you may be eligible for reduced quarantine requirements. Travellers will need to comply with the quarantine requirements in the state or territory of arrival before travelling on to another state or territory. <br>
Australia has established International Safe Travel Zones with select countries, including New Zealand, enabling some quarantine-free travel from New Zealand to Australia. Eligibility and requirements can change quickly. Full details can be found on the <a href=""https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/international-safe-travel-zones"">Department of Home Affairs website</a>.
*Testing/Screening on arrival: Travellers arriving in Australia may need to undergo enhanced health screening on arrival. This can include temperature testing. You may also be asked to undergo screening or testing in quarantine. The Australian authorities provide an <a href=""https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-international-travellers"">‘Information for international travellers fact sheet’</a> to all travellers on arrival in Australia. This provides information on current requirements. For advice and measures at individual airports, see their websites. <br>
*Transiting Australia: The <a href=""https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/transiting-australia"">Department of Home Affairs website</a> sets out information on transiting Australia, including on transit visas. There are currently restrictions on transits due to COVID-19. <br>
Foreign nationals are exempt from Australia’s travel restrictions (and do not need to request an exemption) if transiting Australia for 72 hours or less. Evidence of an onward ticket is required. <br>
Due to COVID-19 related border restrictions, you can usually only travel to Australia to transit to another country if your connecting flight departs from the same airport. <br>
State quarantine requirements remain in place, and airport operating hours vary. This may limit how long you can stay in the airport, and whether you will be subject to the quarantine requirements of the state or territory you have arrived in. <br>
If you have to leave the airport, you may be taken on arrival to a designated quarantine facility. You will need to remain there until returning to the airport for your departing flight. You may need to pay for quarantine - you should check <a href=""https://www.health.gov.au/news/health-alerts/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-health-alert/coronavirus-covid-19-advice-for-travellers"">State and Territory websites</a> for details. <br>
Foreign  nationals are able to transit through Australia for a maximum of 8 hours without a visa. You must remain airside and you will not be able to clear immigration (including to collect baggage, which should have been checked through to your final destination). If your transit time is longer than 8 hours you will need a visa. See the <a href=""https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/transiting-australia"">Department of Home Affairs website</a> for details. If you plan to transit Australia, check the latest entry restrictions for your destination and keep in touch with your airline, cruise line or tour operator before you travel. <br>
*Visas during COVID-19: The latest COVID-19 guidance on visa conditions and details on how to apply for a visa is available on the <a href=""https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/"">Department of Home Affairs website</a>. The guidance is clear that any visa application will be assessed considering the COVID-19 enhanced border measures and the applicant’s individual circumstances. Applications for new visas should be made before a current visa expires, and if a current visa holder has a “no further stay” condition, a request to waive this condition must be made. <br>
If you’re unable to leave Australia and your visa is nearing expiry or has expired already, you should contact the Australian Department of Home Affairs as soon as possible. Australia does not issue visa extensions so you will need to apply for a new visa to remain lawful in Australia, and provide relevant supporting documentation. The type of visa you can apply for to remain in Australia usually depends on the type of visa you currently hold. For example, those on Visitor visas would be expected to apply for new Visitor visas. <br>
You can find more detail for temporary visa holders, including visitors, students and working holiday makers on the Department of Home Affairs <a href=""https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/travel-restrictions"" >webpage</a>.
*Leaving Australia: You should check the <a href=""https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/leaving-australia"">Department of Home Affairs website  </a> for information on leaving Australia, including whether you need an exemption. <br>
As of 1 November, fully vaccinated Australian citizens and permanent residents no longer require an exemption to depart Australia.
If you are an Australian citizen or permanent resident, you will need to present an International COVID-19 Vaccination Certificate (ICVC). If you were vaccinated outside of Australia and do not have an ICVC, you will need to present a foreign vaccination certificate. For full details please refer to the <a href=""https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/vaccinated-travellers"">Department of Home Affairs website</a>.
Australian citizens and permanent residents who are unvaccinated (apart from those under 12 and those who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons) must apply for an exemption to depart Australia. Temporary visa holders do not need an exemption to depart Australia, but may need an exemption to re-enter. However, from December 15 fully vaccinated eligible visa holders will be able to enter Australia without obtaining an exemption, depending on visa type and vaccination status. Details can be found on the <a href=""https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/vaccinated-travellers#toc-8"">Department of Home Affairs website</a>.

 *Travelling to Azerbaijan: The number of commercial flights to and from Baku is close to pre-pandemic levels. There are also a limited number of commercial international flights available to and from other regional airports. Check with your travel agent about routes and availability of tickets, and check Travel Advice for information on transiting other countries. <br>
The use of a medical mask will be required at all times whilst at the airport and on the flight. It is mandatory to keep the mask on at all times except for specific requirements for example at border control, at the request of an airport official or whilst eating. Azerbaijan’s land borders with all neighbouring countries remain closed. <br>
*Screening The Cabinet of Ministers of Azerbaijan has issued a decree that all passengers 1 year old and over travelling to Azerbaijan will require a negative PCR COVID-19 test taken no more than 72 hours before your flight’s departure to Azerbaijan. Foreign nationals 18 years old and over also require either a ‘COVID-19 passport’, a document confirming full vaccination against COVID-19 or a document showing immunity to COVID-19 in order to enter Azerbaijan. <br>
Entry requirements can change with no notice. You should check with your airline before flying for the most up to date information and to see what documentation they will need. <br>
You should seek to have your test results via email and printed off, or a paper certificate. You may be tested again for COVID-19 and have your temperature checked on arrival into Azerbaijan. You should arrange to take a private test. <br>
Anyone who displays symptoms of COVID-19 on arrival in Azerbaijan will be directed to the medical station at the airport. From there the case will be reported to the Emergency Medical Services. <br>
If you are arriving to Azerbaijan via a third country, you will still be required to produce a negative PCR COVID-19 test certificate on arrival even if your airline does not request one for boarding part of your journey. There is no longer a requirement for arrivals to Azerbaijan to self-isolate. <br>
*Demonstrating your COVID-19 status: Azerbaijan will accept the proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
From 15 February 2022, Azerbaijan classifies someone as being vaccinated only if they have had their second vaccination or booster vaccination within the past 6 months. If you can prove you have contracted COVID within the past 6 months that is also acceptable. The detail and application of COVID-19 rules can change at short notice. You should regularly check the latest requirements and ensure you have documentation of full vaccination from either the local medical authorities or your country of residence. <br>
*Departure from Azerbaijan: Azerbaijan does not require you to produce a negative COVID-19 test to depart the country. However, you should check any testing requirements of the airlines that you are boarding, the country you are travelling to, as well as any countries you may be transiting to see what testing requirement they may have to enable you to travel. You should seek to have any test results you need to produce to fly received via email and printed off, or a paper certificate. <br>

*Public places and services: There are currently no restrictions on travel around Azerbaijan. Most businesses and services are open. Almost all public places are only accessible for those with a ‘COVID-19 Passport’ showing proof of vaccination or immunity. Supermarkets and chemists are exempt. British nationals vaccinated through the Azerbaijani vaccination programme can access a ‘COVID-19 Passport’ via the local medical authorities (TABIB). Travellers to Azerbaijan, who have a ‘COVID-19 passport’ issued from their country of residence, can also present this either in a digital format, or as a printed certificate, to gain access to public places. From 15 February 2022, Azerbaijan classifies someone as being vaccinated only if they have had their second vaccination or booster vaccination within the past 6 months. If someone can prove they have contracted COVID within the past 6 months that is also acceptable. The detail and application of COVID-19 rules can change at short notice. You should regularly check the latest requirements and ensure you have documentation of full vaccination from either the local medical authorities or your country of residence.  The wearing of masks outdoors is not mandatory. The wearing of masks indoors remains mandatory. Failure to follow mask-wearing rules could incur a 100 AZN fine. <br>
The Baku Metro and public transport services within Baku are running as normal. Most long distance train services remain suspended. <br>
*Local lockdowns: Local lockdowns could be applied at very short notice. You should monitor local news outlets regularly for the latest updates. <br>
*Accommodation: Hotels are open in Azerbaijan.
*If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.

Accepted tests include tests which were taken at an approved or recognised laboratory by a healthcare provider via a nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal sample (or both). Your test certificate should provide this information. LAMP tests, rapid antigen tests, self-administered tests or home kits or tests using saliva samples will not be accepted. You should check the protocols to confirm and understand all requirements. Relevant test accrediting bodies and standards authorities include: ISO 15189, CAP, UKAS or the equivalent. <br>
All passengers are also required to submit an Embarkation/Disembarkation (ED) card 24 hours prior to travel, to which they should upload their negative test result via <a href=""https://www.travelform.gov.bb/home"">Travel Form</a>. The BIMSafe app can also be used. <br>
If you arrive in Barbados from the UK without a valid negative PCR test, you may be denied entry to the country. You should arrange to take a private test. On arrival all passengers are also subject to a health screen. <br>
If you have recovered from recently diagnosed COVID-19 and your pre-flight PCR test is still positive, you should bring a letter from your medical practitioner with lab test results showing the date of diagnosis and recovery. You may be obliged on arrival to complete an assessment at one of the government isolation facilities for up to 48 hours before being released from quarantine. <br>
*Demonstrating your COVID-19 status: Barbados will accept the proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
*Fully vaccinated arrivals: Fully vaccinated persons (2 doses administered more than 14 days prior to arrival) must arrive with evidence of an RT-PCR test taken during the three days prior to arrival in Barbados. <br>
Details of what the Barbadian authorities will accept as proof of vaccination can be found in the <a href=""https://www.visitbarbados.org/covid-19-travel-guidelines-2020"">Barbados Travel Protocols</a>. If you are unable to provide sufficient proof that you have been vaccinated then you will be treated as if you are unvaccinated. A number of fully vaccinated arrivals will be randomly chosen to have a rapid antigen test. There is no requirement to quarantine, as the result will be made available very quickly. See the <a href=""https://www.visitbarbados.org/covid-19-travel-guidelines-2020"">Barbados Travel Protocols</a> for further details. <br>
*Quarantine for unvaccinated arrivals: Unvaccinated arrivals will be quarantined at approved facilities (a designated holding hotel, approved villa or a government facility at your own expense) and undergo a second PCR test 5 days after arrival. You will need to remain in your hotel room and may be required to wear an electronic tracking bracelet until you receive the results of your second test. The government aims to return results within 48 hours, although return times can sometimes be longer than this. If the result of that second test is negative, you will not be subject to further quarantine.
See the <a href=""https://www.visitbarbados.org/covid-19-travel-guidelines-2021""> Barbados Travel Protocols</a> for full details. <br>
*Testing positive for / close contact with COVID-19 in Barbados: If you test positive for COVID-19 at any point during your stay in Barbados you will be required to self-isolate. You will first be assessed by a member of staff from the government isolation facilities for 24 hours. You may be transferred to the Government’s quarantine facility, Harrison’s Point, for further assessment and treatment. You can stay there for no cost until you have recovered. Conditions at the government quarantine facilities are generally basic and not necessarily equivalent to a tourist hotel with the associated services. <br>
Alternatively, you may be eligible for the Government’s home isolation programme and you have the option of requesting to self-isolate at your hotel, apartment or villa, or government approved isolation property under strict stipulations that must be signed and adhered to. This will be at your own expense. You will need to remain at your designated accommodation until the Barbadian authorities are satisfied that you have recovered. This may mean a mandatory stay of several weeks in Barbados. Upon recovery, tourists can continue their holiday or return home. The option to self-isolate in an approved hotel, villa or property is not a right – the decision will be made by healthcare professionals. See the <a href=""https://www.visitbarbados.org/covid-19-travel-guidelines-2020"">Barbados Travel Protocols</a> for full details of isolation options, facilities and requirements. <br>
If you are deemed to have been in close contact with a positive COVID-19 case, you will be required to quarantine at approved facilities. See <a href=""https://www.visitbarbados.org/covid-19-travel-guidelines-2020"">Barbados Travel Protocols</a> for full details. <br>
You can find full and definitive details of the protocols at <a href=""https://www.visitbarbados.org/covid-19-travel-guidelines-2020"">Visit Barbados website</a> and are advised to read and understand the requirements carefully before departure. <br>

•        care establishments <br>
•        publicly accessible areas in businesses, companies, public buildings, courthouse buildings <br>

From 1 March 2022, those who have received a second vaccine dose (or, in the case of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, their sole dose) more than 150 days ago, will no longer count as fully vaccinated for domestic purposes within Belgium without a booster shot. Therefore they will need additional proof of Covid safe status (e.g. negative test, recovery certificate) to enter specific venues (e.g. restaurants and bars, cinemas, most museums, and many events). <br>
These measures are kept under active review and are subject to an ongoing assessment of local conditions. There are also some regional differences in the implementation of measures.

 International Restrictions: <br>
*Entry by air: Entry requirements in response to COVID-19 are subject to change at short notice and travellers are strongly advised to review these directly with the Brazilian authorities prior to travel. <br>
Most people aged 12 or over travelling to Brazil by air will have to present documentary evidence of a negative PCR test for COVID-19 taken within 72 hours of boarding. Alternatively, they may present a negative antigen test taken within 24 hours of boarding. All forms of proof should be in English, Spanish or Portuguese and shown to airline staff at check-in. Details of exemptions – including for some children travelling with an adult furnishing the above documentary evidence – can be found on the <a href=""http://cglondres.itamaraty.gov.br/en-us/travelling_to_brazil.xml"">Brazilian government’s website</a>.
Most non-resident foreign travellers coming to Brazil by air or land will now need to show proof of full vaccination with any COVID-19 vaccine approved by the <a href=""https://covid19.trackvaccines.org/agency/who/"">World Health Organization’s Emergency Use Listing (WHO)</a>. Details of exemptions can be found on the <a href=""http://cglondres.itamaraty.gov.br/en-us/travelling_to_brazil.xml"">Brazilian government’s website</a>.
Brazil will accept the proof of COVID-19 vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies, as these are in line with the <a href=""http://cglondres.itamaraty.gov.br/en-us/travelling_to_brazil.xml"">Brazilian government guidelines</a> for certification. proof of recovery from COVID-19 certificates are not accepted by Brazil. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to travel. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
Most unvaccinated travellers, or travellers without proof of vaccination, will not usually be granted access to Brazil unless they meet the criteria set out <a href=http://cglondres.itamaraty.gov.br/en-us/travelling_to_brazil.xml"""">by the Brazilian authorities</a>. In this case, they may also be required to undergo quarantine for 14 days. Some exemptions exist, including for children under 12, please check with the Brazilian authorities prior to travel. <br>
All travellers to Brazil are currently required to complete a Travelers Health Declaration form within 24 hours of boarding their flight. This can be done online. The English version is available <a href=""https://formulario.anvisa.gov.br/?lang=en"">here</a>.
Brazilian and resident foreign nationals, who have been in the above countries during the last 14 days, may be allowed to enter Brazil. However, they have to comply with a 14 day quarantine period. <br>
*Entry by land: Brazil has re-opened all of its land boarders. For entry by land, travellers are required to present evidence of a negative PCR or Antigen test, as well as proof of full COVID-19 vaccination. However, unlike the requirements for those arriving by air, foreign travellers arriving by land without proof of vaccination are only permitted entry if they are seeking to transit through Brazil to their country of ordinary residence. <br>
Transiting: If you are in a bordering country and need to cross the land border to board a flight back to your country of residence, you should get in touch with the British Embassy or Consulate. You will be permitted to enter Brazil with authorisation from the Federal Police following an official request from the Embassy and on presentation of flight tickets. You should travel straight to the airport once in Brazil. <br>
*Sea ports: Following a recommendation from the Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA), the Brazilian Government has temporarily suspended domestic cruise ships from operating along the Brazilian coast. Given the fluid coronavirus situation globally, such cruises are likely to remain subject to disruption at short notice throughout 2022. <br>
The Brazilian government continues to suspend the entry of all international cruise ships and prohibits most foreigners from disembarking at any port or other maritime location in Brazil regardless of nationality. These restrictions do not apply to resident foreigners and foreign spouses, children, parents or custodians of a Brazilian national. <br>
Disembarkation will only be permitted when medical assistance is required or to catch a connecting flight back to the passenger’s country of residence. <br>

 *Travel in Brazil: Restrictions vary from city to city.<br>
The use of face masks in streets, public spaces such as parks, and on public transport including taxis is mandatory across the country.<br>
There are additional local requirements to show proof of vaccination and/or for the compulsory use of masks in certain places, such as shops, cinemas and gyms. These are in force, in various cities including São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte and Brasília. <br>
Social isolation measures have been lifted to an extent in some parts of the country, but localised lockdowns continue to varying degrees. You should refer to official guidance in your location for details of what preventative measures are in place and how you can comply with them. Failing to comply with these rules may result in a fine. <br>
*Accommodation: Some accommodation options are open such as hotels, hostels and private rentals but this varies area by area. Some popular beach areas remain closed to non-residents. Check with your accommodation provider what facilities, including restaurants, are available. <br>
Public spaces and services: The situation varies around Brazil, each state will determine local measures to limit the spread of COVID-19, and this includes regulation on the opening of non-essential services (shops, restaurants, bars, beaches and other leisure activities). You should refer to official guidance in your location for details of what preventative measures are in place and how you can comply with them. It’s highly possible that public places likely to attract large crowds may be closed at short notice. For example, several cities have decided not to host the traditional street Carnival in 2022. These include Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Recife and Salvador, although controlled events are still expected to take place.

Internations Restrictions:<br>
 *Entry to Cameroon: There are multiple commercial flight options to enter and leave Cameroon. Access across Cameroon’s land and sea borders is currently restricted due to COVID-19. <br>
Travel requirements to enter and exit Cameroon can change without notice and without proactive communication. The Centre for the Coordination of Public Health Emergency Operations conditions of entry and exit to Cameroon <a href=""https://www.ccousp.cm/urgences-sanitaires/Fcovid-19/condition-dentree-et-sortie-au-cameroun/"">website</a> is the best source of the latest information. <br>
You must have proof of a recent (no older than 72 hours before first boarding) negative coronavirus PCR test to board your flight to Cameroon and to enter at Yaoundé or Douala Airports. <br>
The Government of Cameroon demands a negative Coronavirus PCR test from all travellers aged five and above. (Some airlines demand a PCR test from travellers aged two and above, so check with your airline.)
Your negative coronavirus test result should be in PDF format, clearly stating the date of the test and the type of test (which should be PCR). Electronic copies are accepted. You should arrange to take a private test. <br>
*Testing/screening on arrival: All international travellers are subjected to extra, rapid flow, testing for Coronavirus on arrival at Yaoundé and Douala international airports. This is the Rapid Flow test. At present this includes all passengers arriving from Europe, including the UK. These tests are compulsory. Results are returned while passengers are at the airport. There is no fee. <br>
This is in addition to the requirement to have a negative PCR test 72 hours before embarkation on the first leg of your journey to Cameroon.
*Quarantine requirements: If you have a proof of a recent (no older than 72 hours before boarding) negative coronavirus test, you will normally not have to self-isolate. Anyone that has developed symptoms of Coronavirus on their travel or tests positive on arrival at Yaoundé or Douala airport will be held for further enquiries to trace contacts and movements. We believe that anyone testing positive can quarantine at the location of your host or private accommodation until a negative PCR test is produced.These requirements are regularly evolving. <br>
*Exit Requirements: All travellers leaving Cameroonian territory must present a negative PCR or a rapid flow test result at the airport from the last 72 hours. You should take a PCR test, with a QR barcode. Your country of destination or transit may have other requirements. <br>

  Internal Restrictions: <br>
 *Travel in Cameroon: Travel within the country should be limited to essential travel only. The authorities have banned public transport (taxis, buses, motorbikes) from taking more passengers than they have seats. <br>
You must wear a mask or face covering to be allowed to enter any airport in Cameroon.  <br>
*Accommodation: Accommodation is generally open at the current time. <br>
*Public places and services: Gatherings of over 50 people are prohibited. Restrictions on bars, restaurants and entertainment spots have been lifted. <br>
Visits to public institutions, including government buildings, have been limited.
You must wear a face mask in public spaces and there is occasional sanctioning of those people found to have breached restrictions and any confinement measures imposed on them. <br>
Schools and other educational establishments have reopened after closure during the summer of 2020. However, in the North West and South West regions, many remain closed due to the ongoing conflict. <br>

*Entry rules in response to coronavirus: The Chilean Government has a <a href=""https://saludresponde.minsal.cl/plan-fronteras-protegidas-1-de-diciembre/"">‘Fronteras Protegidas’</a> (Protected Borders) Strategy. <br>
You are allowed to enter Chile if you are: <br>
•        a Chilean national or a resident foreign national; or
a non-resident foreign national only if you have proof of vaccination validated by the Chilean authorities prior to travel. To do this, you must apply online to have your vaccination validated and receive a Chilean “Pase de Movilidad” (Mobility Pass) by visiting <a href=""https://mevacuno.gob.cl/"">MeVacuno website </a>. You should allow up to 30 days for your application to be processed. <br>
•        or you fall into one of the ‘exceptions’ listed in <a href=""https://saludresponde.minsal.cl/viajeros-extranjeros-2/"">Decree 102</a>. You should contact the nearest Chilean Consulate/Embassy prior to travel. <br>
•        and hold travel insurance covering a minimum of $30,000 USD for COVID-related issues. This also applies for authorised non-resident foreigners listed in Decree 102. <br>
•        From 1 December, all children under 6 years old (including non-resident foreigners) regardless of their vaccination status are allowed to enter Chile. <br>
•        From 1 December, entry is prohibited to all non-resident foreign nationals who have been in South Africa, Zimbawe, Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini and Mozambique during the last 14 days. <br>
•        Chilean and resident foreign nationals, who have been in the above countries during the last 14 days, are allowed to enter Chile. However, they have to undergo an antigen or PCR-test on arrival and comply with a 7-day quarantine period. <br>
All travellers (including Chileans, resident and authorised non-resident foreign nationals) must: <br>
•        have a negative PCR test SARS-COV-2 (rapid and antigen tests are not acceptable), taken not more than 72 hours before boarding the final flight into Santiago. Children under 2 years old are exempt<br>
•        <a href=""https://www.c19.cl/"">complete an Affidavit</a> (Declaración Jurada) up to 48 hours before boarding. This will generate a QR-code by separate email, which you must show to the airline and during the health screening process on arrival in Chile. Health authorities at Santiago Airport will request all travellers complete a daily ‘self-report’ – for 10 days – via an online form or ‘C19 AutoReporte’ application. The health authorities will provide the detail of this process by email following the health screening.
•        follow the instructions of airport authorities to undergo an antigen or PCR test SARS-COV-2 either in the airport or at an external laboratory outside the airport. If the latter, you will need to do this within 24 hours of arrival. If you undergo an antigen test, you will need to wait for the results in the airport. If the result is positive, non-resident foreigners will be denied entry into the country.
•        Mobility Pass holders will need to remain in quarantine until you receive a negative test result. Resident foreign nationals without a valid Mobility Pass will need to remain in quarantine for 7 days, regardless of a negative antigen or PCR test result. <br>
The air borders entry points currently open for those who meet these entry requirements are: <br>
•        Arturo Merino Benítez airport <br>
•        Iquique airport <br>
•        Antofagasta airport <br>
•        Punta Arenas airport <br>
*Demonstrating your COVID-19 status: Chile will accept the proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. You will need to use this to apply for a Chilean Mobility Pass (‘Pase de Movilidad’) on the Chile Government’s <a href=""https://mevacuno.gob.cl/"">MeVacuno website </a> in order to be able to enter the country. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered within 6 months prior to travel. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
Our latest understanding is that non-resident foreign nationals with two vaccinations will be entitled to a Mobility Pass valid for 30 days, those with a booster shot will be entitled to 90 days validity. <br>
*Public health measures on arrival in Chile: Upon arrival, all travellers, will be required to undergo another PCR or antigen test and self-isolate until they receive the negative PCR-test result. This is in addition to the negative test they undertook prior to travel. Resident foreign nationals without a valid Mobility Pass will need to remain in quarantine for 7 days, regardless of a negative antigen or PCR test result. Health authorities at Santiago Airport will require completion of a follow-up online form for 10 days from the arrival date. <br>
If you arrive in Chile with a domestic connecting flight, you do not need to quarantine on arrival. You can continue your trip and quarantine in your final destination until you receive a negative PCR test result. <br>
Please note that you will be required to provide a valid Mobility Pass in order to travel on a domestic connecting flight. <br>
Quarantine requirements for travellers who must self-isolate: <br>
•        Strict quarantine in private or declared residence or at a hotel. Transit hotels are no longer an option to quarantine <br>
•        If you choose to quarantine in a hotel, you cannot leave the hotel room. <br>
•        All other residents at the registered quarantine address must also quarantine for the same length of time <br>
•        You must use private transportation to reach the registered address <br>
•        From 1 December, if travel companions of children under 6 years old have validated their vaccines, regardless of their booster shot status, only the child will have to remain in quarantine.

Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in Chile: Travellers arriving in Chile should be aware that local authorities frequently move municipalities (comunas) back and forth through the government Stages Plan (Paso a Paso). You should review the <a href=""https://www.gob.cl/coronavirus/pasoapaso#situacioncomunal/"">Chilean Government Paso a Paso website  </a> to check which stage your ‘comuna’ is in. <br>
If you are travelling from or to the airport to catch a flight from or to one of the areas under quarantine, presenting your passport and boarding pass will permit you to cross any checkpoints. Use a recognised taxi service or airport transfer whose driver should have the requisite permissions. <br>
*Mobility Pass for interregional travel: Travellers (including children aged 12 and up) are required to hold a Mobility Pass for interregional travel. More details on accepted vaccines and the process to apply for the Mobility Pass, including the documents required to validate the vaccination, is available <a href=""https://www.c19.cl/"">here</a> (in Spanish). <br>
The Chilean government allows Chileans, foreigners resident in Chile and non-resident foreigners who have been vaccinated overseas to register for Chile’s Mobility Pass scheme (‘Pase de Movilidad’). You may obtain a Mobility Pass if you fulfil the eligibility criteria on the Chile Government’s<a href=""https://mevacuno.gob.cl/"">MeVacuno website </a>  . This will generate a QR-code after entering your personal information. This permit can only be requested 14-days after completing a full COVID-19 vaccination course in Chile (i.e. after the second dose for a two-dose course COVID-19 vaccine such as AstraZeneca, Pfizer, etc). <br>
Interregional travellers without a Mobility Pass are required to provide proof of a negative PCR-test result given within 72 hours prior to travel. This test must be carried out in Chile. You should be aware that you are not allowed interregional travel if you are in quarantine after arriving in Chile. Non-resident foreign nationals will need to hold a valid Mobility Pass. <br>
*Paso a Paso Strategy: The Chilean government’s strategy to manage COVID-19 is called ‘Paso A Paso’. It has five stages: <br>
•        Stage 1 – Restriction <br>
•        Stage 2 – Transition <br>
•        Stage 3 – Preparation <br>
•        Stage 4 - Initial Reopening <br>
•        Stage 5 - Advanced Reopening <br>
Individual comunas will move forwards or backwards between these stages, depending on the level of COVID-19 infections in the region. Changes to the stage of a ‘comuna’ can be announced by the government at any time and come into force shortly after. All rules for each Stage (Paso) will apply seven-days a week. <br>
In those areas under Stage 1 ‘Restriction’ you are only allowed to leave your residence under certain circumstances, including for medical reasons, basic services, and public services. If you need to leave your residence for food or medical supplies, you must get a permit from the <a href=""https://comisariavirtual.cl/"">Comisaria Virtual</a> . Foreigners may use their passport number to access the system. The pages are only in Spanish. <br>
For further detailed information on rules for every Stage, you should review the Chilean Government <a href=""https://www.gob.cl/coronavirus/pasoapaso/"">Paso a Paso website</a>.
*Public places and services: Chilean authorities require the use of facemasks in all public spaces, that you keep to social distancing rules; self-isolate immediately if you suspect you have been in contact with a confirmed COVID case irrespective of the ‘Paso a Paso’ stage. <br>
*If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.

 **Entry and transit: You will need a valid visa to enter China. The Chinese Visa Application Centres in London, Manchester and Edinburgh are operating but with limited opening hours. The Application Centre in Belfast remains closed. <br>
The Chinese authorities have suspended all direct flights from the UK. This measure will be subject to review but no date has been announced. Restrictions on travel to China from other countries, and the necessary requirements, may be different. British nationals travelling to China from a third country should follow the directions on the website of the local Chinese Embassy or consulate for requirements from that country. <br>
On 4 November 2020 the Chinese Embassy in the UK announced the temporary suspension of entry into China by non-Chinese nationals in the UK holding Chinese visas or residence permits valid at the time of the announcement. Entry by holders of diplomatic, service, courtesy or C visas would not be affected. Foreign nationals visiting China for emergencies can still apply for visas at Chinese Embassies or Consulates and entry by non-Chinese nationals in the UK with visas issued after 3 November 2020 will not be affected. <br>
In order to receive a Health Declaration Form from the Chinese Embassy you must provide evidence of a negative nucleic acid test seven days before you travel, followed by a negative nucleic acid and an IgM antibody test for COVID-19 taken no more than 48 hours before you travel.<br>

This does not mean the provider must carry out both tests, but that the provider must guarantee both test reports. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test from one of the eligible providers. <br>
A limited number of international flights from other countries are flying into Beijing. Other international passenger flights to Beijing continue to be diverted to 16 designated airports in Chengdu, Changsha, Hefei, Lanzhou, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, Hohhot, Jinan, Qingdao, Nanjing, Shenyang, Dalian, Zhengzhou, Xi’an and Wuhan. A small number of international flights are also operating direct between European cities and Shanghai, Guangzhou and Qingdao. <br>

You should follow guidance for alternative entry requirements. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination.<br>
*Health checks on arrival: All international arrivals will be subject to PCR testing on arrival, during and after quarantine. Even asymptomatic carriers will be isolated in a Covid hospital until they return at least three consecutive negative results. There have been some cases of individuals testing intermittently positive for a number of weeks. Travellers with a history of COVID-19 infection should consider leaving a gap between an infection and travel to China. All travellers should take precautions before and during travel to minimise as far as possible the chances of testing positive on arrival. <br>
Health regulations surrounding passengers arriving from overseas are continuously changing. before you travel if you have any questions regarding these entry requirements, quarantine rules or the requirements for individual cities. <br>

Quarantine is usually spent at either a centralised government hotel (with costs covered by the traveller) or your home. Quarantine requirements can change at short notice and may differ from province to province. <br>
Follow-up swab tests are likely to take place during your quarantine period. Family members of someone who tests positive, or those who have been in close contact, will need to go into a government quarantine hospital. <br>
For all quarantine arrangements in China: <br>
•        unless directed by the authorities you’re not allowed to leave your designated quarantine location for 14 days. This means you’re also unable to leave China for the duration of the quarantine <br>
•        depending on the quarantine location, facilities may be basic: there may be no fridge, no air-conditioning, and limited or no internet/wifi <br>
•        during your stay you will be responsible for cleaning the room <br>
•        if meals are not available at the quarantine location, you will need to arrange food orders for delivery from outside <br>
•        larger sized families with two parents may be separated into 2 rooms. <br>

Quarantine is enforced at the neighbourhood level and procedures vary, so check in advance. <br>
The possibility that local authorities impose mandatory quarantine in response to fresh outbreaks is high.

 <br>
 International Restrictions:<br>
*Entry to Ethiopia: There are special measures in place at all borders when entering Ethiopia. Proof of a negative COVID-19 RT PCR test result issued within the previous 120 hours (5 days), starting from the time the sample is given, is required for all air passengers over the age of 10 years entering Ethiopia. Arrivals must then complete 7 days mandatory self-quarantine. You should arrange to take a private test. <br>
*Transiting Ethiopia: Transit passengers are those with an onward ticket to another destination, who do not formally enter Ethiopia. Transiting passengers are exempt from the current quarantine restrictions for COVID-19. The maximum transit time is 72 hours. <br>
While you don’t need a negative COVID-19 test to transit Addis Ababa, you should ensure that you have the correct tests for your onward journey.<br>
Passengers transiting for 24 hours or less can remain in the departure lounge of the airport. For transits over 24 hours, you will be taken to a designated transit hotel for the duration of your stay. On arrival in Addis Ababa Bole International Airport, you should report to the transit desk to confirm your hotel details. After health screening and immigration you will then need to present your hotel details and passport to the desk marked “transit shuttle bus” from where you will be taken to the hotel. You will not be able to leave the hotel during your transit. To the extent airline schedules allow, you should therefore minimise the duration of your transit in Addis Ababa. <br>
Passengers transiting Addis Ababa Bole International Airport are subject to COVID-19 screening measures during transit. See below. If you have any further questions, you should contact your airline. <br>
*Screening on arrival: Addis Ababa Bole International Airport (and other international airports) have put in place measures to screen passengers arriving, departing or transiting through Ethiopia. Screening may include checking COVID-19 test results, temperature measurements, completing a health screening questionnaire and answering questions from health officials on recent travel and your accommodation details for your self-isolation (see Quarantine requirements below). <br>
Anyone who is suspected of having COVID-19 will be taken to a government designated isolation centre where they will receive appropriate follow-up care and will be tested. They will likely have to remain in isolation until they test negative. Any person that tests positive for COVID-19 may be prohibited from entering Ethiopia. Anyone with a pre-existing condition that requires regular medicines should bring sufficient amounts to cover a potential unplanned additional 2 week stay. <br>
*COVID-19 Test and Quarantine requirements: Proof of a negative COVID-19 RT PCR test result issued within the previous 120 hours (5 days), starting from the time the sample is given, is required for all air passengers over the age of 10 years entering Ethiopia (except diplomats). Only RT PCR tests will be accepted. You may need to demonstrate you have such a test certificate before boarding your flight. <br>
You will need to complete 7 days mandatory self-isolation on arrival. You must provide the address for your self-isolation upon arrival. However, passengers who have a certificate of recovery from COVID -19 within the last 90 days or have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 are not required to self-isolate. <br>
Diplomats are encouraged to present a negative RT PCR COVID-19 test certificate as above. If they do not present a negative COVID-19 RT PCR test certificate, they will be expected to get an RT PCR or Antigen-Based COVID-19 test upon arrival. If the result is negative, they will not be required to self-isolate. If diplomats do not present a negative test certificate or refuse to get the test on arrival, they will be required to self-isolate for 14 days. You should arrange to take a private test. <br>
*Land border quarantine: Measures are in place when arriving into the country across land borders. Those crossing with a negative RT PCR COVID-19 test certificate dated within the previous 120 hours (5 days) with digital reference code (see Entry to Ethiopia) will be screened for symptoms and required to self-isolate at home for 7 days. Those that do not present a negative test certificate will be screened and required to self-isolate for 14 days. Only PCR tests will be accepted. <br>
Anyone who has a certificate of recovery from COVID -19 within 90 days or who has been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 will not be required to complete 7 days self-quarantine. Anyone who is suspected of having COVID-19 will be taken to a government designated isolation centre where they will receive appropriate follow-up care and a further test. The standard of isolation centres varies significantly around the country. You should check for the latest information with local authorities before travelling to the border. <br>

In order to opt for the 5-day “test to release” you must provide proof you have completed the full course of a vaccination approved by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) at least two weeks before your arrival in the Falkland Islands.

If you or anyone you are sharing quarantine accommodation with test positive on either occasion you must remain in quarantine for the full 10 days. In this case you will be offered an additional swab on day 9 (prior to the end of the quarantine period on day 10) and you may be asked to continue to self-isolate after the end of the quarantine period, especially if you develop symptoms of coronavirus. <br>

Internal Restrictions: <br>
As of 15 February, new rules are in place in France regarding the need for a COVID-19 booster vaccination to access France's Pass Vaccinal – relevant for both residents and tourists visiting the country (Forbes, 16.02.2022).<br> 
*Travel in France: Face masks are mandatory in all enclosed public spaces. The use of face masks is mandatory in some city centres. Please check local guidance for more information. Across France, masks are still compulsory in large gatherings, queues, markets and stadiums. <br>
Wearing masks on public transport is compulsory for all users aged 11 and over, with fines for those who are not compliant. Masks are also compulsory in taxis and private hire vehicles without a plexiglass screen. <br>
Some travel operators such as airlines may specify types of masks to be worn on board e.g. surgical masks, and may encourage you to take spares for long journeys. Please check with your travel operator before travelling. <br>
Certain forms of transport, such as cross country trains, will require passengers to demonstrate their COVID-19 status through the “pass sanitaire”. For further details on what this involves see the ‘public spaces and services’ section below. <br>
There are no internal travel restrictions in France. You should visit the <a href=""https://www.interieur.gouv.fr/Actualites/L-actu-du-Ministere/Attestations-de-deplacement-couvre-feu"">French Interior Ministry website  </a> or use the ‘TousAntiCovid’ digital app for further information. <br>
These measures may change at short notice either at national or at local level. You should check <a href=""https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus"">local guidance</a>
 for further information.
Full information about restrictions in France can be found <a href=""https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus."">here</a>.
*Public spaces and services: From 3 January until 2 February 2022, indoor events will be limited to 2,000 people indoors and 5,000 people outdoors. <br>
Until 16 February, food or drink are not permitted in a range of venues, including cinemas, theatres, sporting venues and on transport (including long-distance journeys). Food and drink are only permitted sitting down rather than standing up in bars and cafes. Standing concerts are banned and nightclubs are closed. <br>
*Pass vaccinal: On 24 January 2022, the “pass vaccinal” (vaccine pass) entered into force, replacing the “pass sanitaire” for people aged 16 and over to demonstrate their COVID-19 vaccination status to access services and venues (for the latest list see the <a href=""https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus/pass-vaccinal"">French government website </a>). The following proof can be used in order to obtain a ‘pass vaccinal’: <br
1.        Proof of full vaccination, including a booster dose if you’re 18 years and 1 month old (as outlined below in ‘Proof of vaccination’). <br>
2.        Proof of recovery for COVID-19, dated more than 11 days ago and less than 6 months ago. <br>
3.        Proof of a medical exemption from vaccination, including a document from your doctor to this effect. <br>
Proof of a negative test result will no longer be accepted. Those aged 12-15 will continue to be able to use a “pass sanitaire”, for which proof of a negative test will continue to be accepted. <br>
From 15 January 2022, adults who have been fully vaccinated for more than seven months need to demonstrate they have received an approved COVID-19 booster injection in order to access the “pass vaccinal” in France. From 15 February 2022, the delay for receiving a booster to maintain pass validity will reduce from seven to four months. This applies to visiting tourists and those residing in France. You can access the QR code for your booster in the same way as for previous injections. <br>
The list of places which require a pass to enter is subject to change: the latest list for the ‘pass vaccinal’ is available on the <a href=""https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus/pass-vaccinal"">French government’s website</a>
 (in French). This currently includes, but is not limited to, leisure facilities such as restaurants, bars, museums and sport venues, including ski lifts, and long-distance transport. <br>
*Pass sanitaire: Children aged between 12 and 15 years need to continue to demonstrate their COVID-19 status through the “pass sanitaire” in order to access services and venues. This includes leisure facilities (bars, restaurants, museums, cinemas), hospitals, retirement homes and modes of transport such as long distance train and bus journeys and planes. Adults can continue to access hospitals, care homes and health and social care facilities with a negative test result. You can find more information on how to <a href=""https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus/pass-sanitaire"">access the “pass sanitaire” from the French government </a>, including the full list of places that require a pass sanitaire to enter. <br>
This can be acquired by fulfilling one of the following three criteria:<br>
1.        A vaccination certificate (see details on proof of vaccination below). <br>
2.        A negative PCR or antigen result from a test taken within the last 24 hours. <br>
3.        A document (dated more than 11 days ago and less than six months ago) proving you have recently recovered from COVID. <br>
Children under 12 are exempt from the ‘pass sanitaire’ and the ‘pass vaccinal’. <br>
*Proof of vaccination: The French government recognises vaccination certificates, which conforms to the EU Digital Covid Status Certification framework, illustrating that you are fully vaccinated with a vaccine authorised by the European Medical Authority. This means:<br>
•        7 days after a second dose of Oxford/AstraZeneca, Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna <br>
•        28 days after a single dose of Johnson & Johnson <br>
•        7 days after a single injection for those able to demonstrate they have already been infected (this only applies to those vaccinated in France) <br>
You may also be required to have a booster dose to be able to obtain the ‘pass vaccinal’ for domestic use in France. Please see the section above for further details. <br>
France will accept the proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
Other Covid status certification that conforms with the EU Digital COVID Certification scheme (e.g. from other EU member states) can also be used for entry into settings where there is a COVID status certification requirement in France. <br>
Facemasks are mandatory in all enclosed public spaces. This applies to those aged 11 and over. It is no longer required to wear a facemask in all outdoor public spaces, with some exceptions, including gatherings, queues, markets, and stadiums. Failure to comply with these restrictions may result in a fine. Please refer to local guidance for more information. <br>
If you test positive for coronavirus in France and you’re fully vaccinated (including a booster, in line with French pass sanitaire requirements) you must self-isolate for 7 days from the day on which you first develop symptoms, or 7 days from the date of the positive test result. Self-isolation can be reduced to 5 days if you take a negative PCR or antigen test (supervised, not self-administered) on day 5 and you have not displayed any symptoms over the previous 48 hours. If you’re unvaccinated or partially vaccinated you must self-isolate for 10 days from the day on which you first develop symptoms, or 10 days from the date of the positive test result. Self-isolation can be reduced to 7 days if you take a negative PCR or antigen test (supervised, not self-administered) on day 7 and you have not displayed any symptoms over the previous 48 hours. <br>
You will have to extend your stay until the end of your isolation period. This could be in your current accommodation. The French authorities do not provide or pay for quarantine accommodation. <br>
Further information is available on the TousAntiCovid application. The French health ministry also operates a dedicated coronavirus helpline on +33 (0)800 130 000.

 International Restrictions: <br>
*Entry to Gabon: The Gabonese government has introduced a ban on flights from Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique, Angola and South Africa, until further notice, in response to the Omicron variant of COVID-19. <br>
In relation to other countries, flight restrictions have eased to allow five flights per airline, per week. Land and sea borders are closed. <br>
All passengers travelling to Gabon must present a valid negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test no older than 3 days or a valid COVID-19 vaccination certificate for entry into Gabon. <br>

Non-vaccinated passengers are required to self-isolate for 5 days in designated hotels at their own expense whilst the COVID-19 test is being processed. Passports will be retained by the immigration authorities during this time and returned after successful completion of the isolation time. If the COVID-19 test is negative, passengers will be issued a test certificate, which is valid for 14 days and can be renewed at the end of this period after another test is undertaken. Holders of vaccination certificates still have to undergo the compulsory testing but can self-isolate in the facility of their choice and do not have to leave their passport. <br>
Travellers holding a diplomatic passport and their travel orders must comply with the mandatory PCR testing at the airport (CFA 50,000), but do not quarantine in a government-designated hotel and do not leave their passport at the airport.

Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Public spaces and services: Both the vaccinated and unvaccinated must continue to adhere to basic non-pharmaceutical guidelines, such as social distancing, wearing masks in enclosed spaces, and regularly ventilating indoor spaces. Wearing a medical-grade mask remains a legal requirement in retail outlets and on public transport. Often an FFP-2 mask is required and you should make sure you have an FFP-2 mask with you. More guidance from the <a href=""https://www.zusammengegencorona.de/en/masking-up-ffp2-masks-to-protect-others-and-yourself/"">Federal Health Ministry</a> is available. <br>
German states often require C-19 certification, such asproof of vaccination, recovery from infection or a negative test (up to 24hrs old for rapid antigen testing or 48 hrs old for PCR testing) will be required for entry into: <br>
•        Hospitals and social care settings<br>
•        Indoor gastronomy<br>
•        Participating in events and celebrations<br>
•        Barbers, hairdressers, or beauty salons<br>
•        Indoor sport such as fitness studios, swimming baths or sports halls<br>
•        Hotels (test at arrival and twice a week during the stay)<br>
Children five years old and above are exempt from domestic testing requirements during term time. As school pupils are regularly tested at school, they only need to show their school pupil card to prove their C-19 status. The fully vaccinated can demonstrate their status using Germany’s two C-19 certification apps (the CovPass-App or the Corona-Warn-App; see below)or the UK COVID Pass. Other vaccination certification is accepted for domestic purposes in electronic form as long as it has:<br>
•        The date of vaccination;<br>
•        Name and batch name of the vaccine;<br>
•        Name of the disease against which vaccination was given;<br>
•        Name of the person vaccinated, their date of birth and the name and address of the person responsible for administering the vaccination, and;<br>
•        Confirmation in writing or in electronic form with a qualified electronic signature or a qualified electronic seal by the person responsible for administering the vaccination.<br>
Germany will accept proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to travel. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
Those who have recently recovered from Covid must show a positive PCR test at least 28 days old but no older than six months. As rules may vary please check the latest <a href=""https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/themen/coronavirus/corona-bundeslaender-1745198"">local guidance</a> (in German). There are a variety of sources in English including <a href=""https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/themen/buerokratieabbau/nina-lokale-corona-hinweise-1827552"">Germany’s NINA Warn App</a>
<br>
*Testing positive for COVID-19 in Germany: Anyone testing positive with a Point of Care (PoC) antigen test is required to take a follow-up PCR test immediately and to self-isolate. Close contacts are also required to self-isolate, although exceptions may apply for those who are fully vaccinated. <br>
In the event of a positive PoC test, the test provider is required to notify the local health office (Gesundheitsamt), which is responsible for monitoring self-isolation and will provide further guidance in individual cases. You can find your local health office by postcode <a href=""https://tools.rki.de/plztool/"">here</a>. <br>
Individuals testing positive must self-isolate in their home or where they are staying locally, or in another appropriate location enabling self-isolation. They may only leave their home and interrupt self-isolation to carry out the PCR test. Germany does not operate a system of managed quarantine in government facilities. <br>
Mandatory self-isolation ceases in the event of a negative PCR test. Otherwise self-isolation lasts for 14 days, or until the local health office confirms release.

Internal Restrictions: <br> 
*Travel in Greece: Travel within Greece between Regional Units is permitted subject to adherence to public health measures as outlined above. You must wear either double masks (at least one of which should be surgical) or an N95/FFP2 mask at all times on all public transport. <br>
Cross-regional travel is allowed for mainland Greece and the islands of Lefkada, Evia and Salamina (use of self-tests ahead of travel is strongly recommended but is not mandatory). Cross-regional travel by air and sea to the rest of Greece is permitted for those aged 12 and above but only with either: <br>
•        proof of vaccination and 14 days since second dose; or  <br>
•        a negative result from a PCR test carried out up to 72 hours prior to travel; or <br>
•        a negative result from a certified rapid test up to 48 hours before travel; or <br>
Children aged 5 to 11, can travel with a negative self-test taken up to 24 hours before the scheduled travel time. If you are travelling by internal (domestic) flights, specific measures relating to check-in, baggage allowances and other details are in place to reduce the spread of coronavirus. You should check with your operator directly for further detail. <br>
*Accommodation: All hotels are permitted to open, and other types of accommodation, including e.g. Airbnb, private rentals and hostels, are also available. However, you should note that many operators are likely to reduce their offer and close some accommodation during the winter months, particularly in light of measures put in place by the Greek authorities to fight the spread of COVID-19. You should check directly with your accommodation provider in case of related concerns.
*Demonstrating your COVID-19 status: Greece will accept the proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. It will also accept proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to you presenting your evidence of vaccination. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
If you are 18 years old or over and more than 7 months have elapsed since you completed your initial vaccination course against COVID-19, Greece considers your vaccination status expired unless you have received a booster vaccine. <br>
This does not affect international travel or entry to Greece, but domestic ‘unvaccinated’ measures will apply within Greece. More information on these measures can be found in the section below. <br>
*Unvaccinated in Greece: If you have not been fully vaccinated or do not have proof of recovery from COVID-19: <br>
•        Travel by aeroplane, train and bus is allowed subject to either a certified negative PCR test in the last 72 hours before the scheduled time of arrival at destination, or to a certified rapid (antigen) test within 48 hours of scheduled arrival at destination; <br>
•        You will not be allowed to enter nightclubs, restaurants (indoors), theatres, cinemas, museums, exhibitions, conferences, gyms and stadiums; <br>
•        You must present proof of a negative rapid test, taken up to 48 hours before entry, to visit other public spaces including shops and restaurants (outdoors); <br>
•        Failure to comply with these rules may be met with fines of up to €5,000; <br>
•        Unvaccinated children (between the ages 4 and 18) require a negative self-test to enter public spaces such as shops, restaurants (indoor and outdoor) and museums <br>
*What to do if you test positive while in Greece
If you test positive for COVID-19 while in Greece you must self-isolate for 5 days from the date of the positive test result. You may leave self-isolation after 5 days if you are no longer experiencing symptoms, otherwise you should continue to self-isolate.
If you have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive and have received your booster, you are not obliged to self-isolate but must take a PCR or rapid test on day 5 of the exposure. If you are unvaccinated or are vaccinated but have not received your booster, you must take a PCR or rapid test and self-isolate for 5 days.
The above guidance may not apply in the case of variants of special interest. These cases will be assessed by the EMEA (Greek health authority) and appropriate instructions will be given.
Depending on the circumstances, you may be able to self-isolate in your current accommodation, or Greek authorities will ask you to self-isolate in a state provided quarantine hotel. The expense of the accommodation in quarantine hotels is covered by the Greek state. Local authorities will be able to offer further advice on self-isolation requirements.
If you do not self-isolate or quarantine when required you may be fined by the Hellenic Police. The fine could be as much as €5000. You should comply with any requirement to self-isolate or quarantine.
*Quarantine hotels: If you test positive for COVID-19 you may have to enter a quarantine hotel. Greece, the Greek authorities will pay the cost of your quarantine. <br>
EHIC or GHIC cards can not be used to cover any additional expenses you incur whilst staying in a quarantine hotel. Make sure you have access to funds to cover the costs or take out insurance, checking the policy has adequate cover. <br>
*Wearing a mask: It is mandatory to wear a mask in all indoor and outdoor public spaces, in all areas of Greece. In certain areas, such as in supermarkets and pharmacies, and on public transport, you will be required to wear either double masks (at least one of which should be surgical), or an N95/FFP2 mask.
*Public spaces and services: All restrictions remain under regular review. In Regional Units (περιφερειακές ενότητες) where the spread of COVID-19 is particularly high and hospital capacity is limited, restrictions may be tighter or re-imposed with limited notice. Check the latest local guidance and follow the advice of local authorities. <br>
Only the most relevant measures to travellers are included below. You should keep up-to-date by checking this page regularly, and following local announcements. <br>
As restrictions may vary, you should <a href=""https://covid19.gov.gr/covid-map-en/"">check the latest local guidance</a>.
•        Proof of vaccination is required to enter public spaces such as shops, restaurants (indoor and outdoor) and museums. You should be prepared to demonstrate your proof of vaccination and present ID (passport or Greek Residence card) when asked. If you are not fully vaccinated (including children),

<br>
 <br>
International Restrictions: <br>
<br>
*Entry to Japan: Foreign nationals who do not have existing resident status are not permitted to enter Japan for any purpose, other than in exceptional circumstances.
You can find a description of exceptional circumstances on the <a href=""https://www.mofa.go.jp/ca/fna/page22e_000921.html#section4"">Ministry of Foreign Affairs website</a>.<br>
This guidance also applies to foreign nationals in possession of visas issued recently who have not yet entered Japan. Further details are available on the <a href=""https://www.mofa.go.jp/ca/fna/page22e_000921.html"">Ministry of Foreign Affairs website</a>, or via Japan’s Visa Information Hotline on +44 (0)800 041 8412. Alternatively, contact your nearest Japanese Embassy for more information, including if you believe you qualify for exceptional circumstances. <br>
*Re-entry to Japan: Foreign nationals with Status of Residence who leave or have left Japan with a valid re-entry permit are in principle allowed to re-enter the country. However, please note that Japan has introduced caps on the number of people permitted to arrive by plane, so bookings on some routes have been restricted or suspended. Those who do not have a valid re-entry permit will be denied re-entry; please consult the Japanese authorities for advice. Those entering the country will need to follow appropriate arrival and quarantine / self-isolation rules as set out below, and provide written evidence of a negative COVID-19 test conducted within the 72 hours before their flight departure time. You should check the Japanese government’s advice on this re-entry process on the <a href=""https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/covid-19/bordercontrol.html"">Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare website</a>.<br>
*Testing/screening on arrival: All passengers arriving in Japan are required to complete a health questionnaire before disembarkation, including contact details. They are then required to undergo a COVID-19 test at the airport. You will be asked to wait for the test results at the airport before moving to your quarantine destination. <br>
*Quarantine and self-isolation requirements: Regardless of vaccination status, travellers entering Japan from countries where the Omicron variant is dominant must undertake 7 days of quarantine and self-isolation. (This reduction from the previous 10-day requirement also applies to travellers who had already commenced their period of quarantine and self-isolation at the time of the announcement). <br>
For those coming from the UK, the first 6 days must be spent in quarantine in a government-provided hotel. You will need to take a COVID-19 test on days 3 and 6 (the day of arrival counts as Day 0). If the tests are negative, you will be permitted to move into self-isolation at home or in a self-arranged hotel for the remainder of the 7-day period. <br>
You will be required to sign a written pledge upon arrival which commits you to these rules. The pledge also commits you to avoiding public transport, submitting to follow-up health checks, installing Japan’s COVID-19 tracing app, and maintaining – and in some cases disclosing – your location data. <br>
Failure to comply with these requests could lead to you being subject to detention under the Quarantine Act. It could also result in the release of your name and information related to reducing the spread of infection and, for foreign nationals, possible revocation of your Status of Residence and subsequent deportation. More details on Japan’s current quarantine rules, including rules for those travelling from countries where COVID variants other than Omicron are dominant, are available on the <a href=""https://www.mofa.go.jp/ca/fna/page4e_001053.html#section3"">Ministry of Foreign Affairs website</a>. New measures may be brought in at short notice. <br>
*Demonstrating your COVID-19 status: Japan will accept proof of COVID-19 vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered more than 14 days prior to travel. If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must have been printed after 1 November 2021 to ensure that the QR code can be scanned successfully. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
*Transiting Japan: The measures listed above do not apply to passengers who are transiting through one Japanese airport and do not go through immigration. If you are transiting using different airports you will need a transit permit on arrival. <br>
To get one you will be required to demonstrate that you have not come from a country on the banned list, that you have timely onward travel plans, and that you will not use public transport to move between airports; this includes taxis. <br>
You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. You should also check the latest entry requirements for your destination. <br>
 <br> 
 <br>
Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in Japan: 36 of Japan’s 47 prefectures (including Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto) are currently under States of Quasi-Emergency. A range of measures is in place, including restrictions on dining, school attendance and large-scale events. <br>
Measures encouraging social distancing, mask-wearing and other basic precautions remain in place even in those prefectures which are not currently under State of (Quasi-)Emergency. Some businesses may be closed, operating with reduced hours, and/or limiting visitor numbers. <br>
A more restrictive State of Emergency, or other rules and controls, may be imposed at short notice. You should follow the instructions of your local authority. <br>
Local authorities may also put in place special measures for natural disaster response, including additional evacuation locations and medical procedures. <br>
*If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.

*Entry to Laos: The government of the Lao PDR has suspended the visa on arrival service at all international entry points. No visas are being issued to people travelling from a country with cases of COVID-19, including the UK.

  <br>
International Restrictions: <br>
*All travellers: You do not need a visa to enter New Zealand as a visitor for up to 6 months, but you will need to get a New Zealand Electronic Travel Authority (NZeTA) before you travel. The New Zealand Government, following a temporary border closure, announced 3 February 2022 a 5-step reopening plan commencing at 11:59pm (New Zealand Time) on 27 February 2022.

The NZeTA costs NZD $9 if applying via the dedicated mobile app, or NZD $12 if completed online. You will also need to pay an International Visitor Conservation and Tourism Levy (IVL) of NZD $35 when you apply. Once issued, the NZeTA is valid for up to two years. The New Zealand immigration authorities recommend that applicants allow up to 72 hours for processing. <br>
On arrival in New Zealand, you will also need to satisfy the Immigration Officer that you meet the criteria for visa-free entry, which includes having an onward ticket and sufficient funds to support you during your stay. You can check the full criteria on the New Zealand Immigration website. New Zealand’s immigration rules are strict, particularly regarding employment. Visitors cannot work in New Zealand. <br>
For more information about visas, visit the <a href=""https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas"">New Zealand Immigration website</a> or contact the nearest <a href=""https://www.mfat.govt.nz/en/embassies"">New Zealand High Commission</a>.
*If you’re fully vaccinated: Non-New Zealand citizens aged 17-years and over arriving into New Zealand, including New Zealand permanent residents and temporary visa holders, must be fully vaccinated.

Your evidence must confirm your last dose was at least 14 days before departure for New Zealand. <br>
Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. You should check that your first name and your surname on your passport match how they are displayed by your COVID Pass at least 2 weeks before you travel. If the names are different, contact your GP practice to have your details updated. <br>

Internal Restrictions: <br> 
*Travel by road: You can enter and depart Poland by car or coach over some land border crossings, though the situation could change quickly. Countries neighbouring Poland may introduce border restrictions at short notice. Check country specific travel advice for any country that you plan to transit during your journey. <br>
The Kuzniсa-Bruzgi road border crossing is currently closed, and more border checkpoints may close or implement restrictions at short notice. Coach services are available between London and Poland (journey times are in excess of 24 hours including Channel crossing).
*Public spaces and services: The Polish government has strict sanitary rules and restrictions in place nationwide. Further guidance can be found on the <a href=""https://www.gov.pl/web/coronavirus"">Polish government website</a>. Further national or regional measures may be implemented at short notice. <br>
Facemasks are compulsory in indoor and enclosed spaces, on public transport, in taxis or in an open space where you are unable to maintain a 1.5 metre distance. You do not need to wear a facemask in a private car. Children under 4 are not required to wear facemasks. If there are medical reasons why you cannot wear a facemask, you must carry a doctor’s note with you explaining this. Bandanas, scarves, balaclavas and visors are not permitted alternatives to facemasks. Your mouth and nose must be covered. <br>
When outside, you should keep a 1.5 metre distance from others, unless you are in the same household, a parent with a child under 13 or the carer of a person with a disability or special needs. <br>
Police and sanitary inspectors are entitled to issue you with an on-the-spot fine (approximately PLN500) if you are found not to be wearing a facemask when you should. Further prosecution could result in a fine of up to PLN 30,000 for failing to follow sanitary rules. <br>
Public transport is operating with a maximum limit of 75% capacity. Gatherings, celebrations and events are allowed for up to 100 people. Fairs, exhibitions, conferences and trade events are required to have a maximum of one person per 15 square metres. <br>

All shops and services are open. Customer numbers are limited in shops. This might mean you have to queue for entry at busy times. In all areas of Poland a facemask must be worn inside shops and hand sanitiser must be used where provided. <br>
Administrative offices may open with limited numbers inside at any one time. You might find some offices are only open by appointment or have restrictions on in-person attendance and you are recommended to check websites or contact the office before travelling as appointments may be limited. <br>
Poland will accept the proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
*Accommodation: Hotels are currently open with a 30% capacity limit. These limits can be increased, but only to those who can provide evidence they are fully vaccinated. <br>

You should contact your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider for information on the impact on any existing travel plans. <br>
*Testing on arrival: Thermal screening and temperature checks will take place on arrival. <br>
*Quarantine requirements: All residents who have completed a vaccination course as recognised by Qatar’s Ministry of Public Health (namely Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca, or Johnson & Johnson), returning to Qatar will be exempt from quarantine provided their last vaccination dose has been administered 14 days prior to entry to Qatar. <br>

 *Travel in Qatar: Qatar’s  <ahref=""https://www.moph.gov.qa/english/Pages/Coronavirus2019.aspx"">Ministry of Public Health</a> has published advice on how to limit the spread of coronavirus, and has introduced a number of precautionary restrictions on travel and events in response to the coronavirus pandemic. <br>
Public transport, including the metro and bus services, operates with a restricted 75% capacity from 3 October 2021. You should wear a mask at all times when using these services. No more than four people are allowed in a vehicle, if they are not part of the same family. The authorities may also stop vehicles to enquire about the reason for the journey. <br>
With effect from 3 October 2021, the requirement to wear facemasks has been relaxed in certain conditions. It is no longer a requirement to wear your mask in open spaces, except when attending organised public events such as markets. You are still required to wear facemasks in places such as mosques, hospitals, schools/universities and shopping malls. <br>
It is compulsory to have Qatar’s contact tracing app, Ehteraz, downloaded and working on your smartphone whenever you leave the house. The authorities are deploying mobile patrols and setting up checkpoints to prevent social gatherings and check compliance with other measures. <br>
Anyone violating these could incur a fine of up to QAR200,000 and/or a prison sentence not exceeding three years. <br>
For further information, <a href=""https://covid19.moph.gov.qa/EN/Precautions-for-lifting-restrictions/Business-Leisure/Pages/Shopping-Malls.aspx"">visit the Ministry of Public Health webpage</a>.
*Accommodation: Hotels are open, and facilities (i.e. gyms, pool) have reopened subject to restrictions on capacity. Some hotels are being used as quarantine locations. <br>
*Public places and services: With effect from 3 October 2021 restrictions on the number of people at gatherings have eased. Indoors, a maximum of 30 vaccinated people can gather in a group. If there is an unvaccinated person in the group, that limit drops to five people. Outdoors, a maximum of 50 vaccinated people can gather in a group. If there is an unvaccinated person in the group, that limit drops to ten people. Capacity restrictions also apply in restaurants, malls, hairdressers and outdoor swimming pools. <br>
You will be asked to show your vaccinated status on the Ehteraz app to enter most locations. If you are unvaccinated, entry may be denied. Playgrounds and exercise equipment in public spaces have been reopened, operating on a restricted capacity basis. Restrictions in mosques have eased but worshippers are reminded to follow the guidance on social distance, mask wearing and general prevention measures. Entry may be dependent on presenting evidence that you are fully vaccinated. <br>
From 3 October 2021 schools will return to lessons in person, with unvaccinated students over the age of 12 being required to undertake a weekly COVID-19 test. For further details you should contact the school directly. <br>

International Restrictions: <br>
*Transiting in South Korea: All transit passengers receive a temperature check on arrival in Korea. Symptomatic individuals will be subject to a COVID-19 test and hospitalisation if found positive. Passengers who do not show symptoms and/or test negative may continue their journey. Transit passengers at Seoul Incheon Airport require a ticket/boarding pass for their onward flight to their final destination. They should confirm with the airline(s) before departure that their bags have been checked through to their final destination (as transit passengers are not able to collect and re-check in baggage on arrival in Incheon Airport). Transit hotels are available in both Terminals 1 and 2 at Incheon Airport. <br>
*Testing on arrival: All foreign nationals arriving in South Korea (except children under the age of six and individuals with quarantine exemptions for “humanitarian reasons” – i.e. to attend a funeral – or official business reasons) are required to provide a negative PCR test certificate. LAMP tests are accepted. The test must have been taken within the 48 hours prior to departure. <br>
All arrivals – including children under the age of six, and regardless of nationality and length of stay – are also required to be tested for coronavirus (COVID-19) within 24 hours after entering South Korea. If you are not resident in South Korea, you will be taken for testing and must remain at the testing facility until a negative result has been secured. <br>
If you have recently recovered from COVID-19, you will still need to receive a negative PCR test result as described above before you are able to fly to South Korea. You should bring with you an official note from your doctor detailing when you tested positive, what treatment you received and/or what isolation you observed. If you test positive or inconclusive on arrival, Korean officials will consider this information when deciding how to proceed. Some British Nationals have tested negative in the UK and then tested positive on arrival in South Korea. Korean health officials have broad discretion in deciding what precautions are required and you may be required to quarantine even if you are no longer testing positive. <br>
*Quarantine and quarantine exemptions: The default requirement when entering South Korea is to quarantine for seven days at home (if you are resident in South Korea) or in a government quarantine facility (if you are visiting). You can avoid quarantine entirely if you have a ‘quarantine exemption’. If you’re visiting, you can quarantine with relatives if you can prove your relationship to them and if their accommodation meets certain standards. <br>
You can apply for a quarantine exemption if you have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19. The process of applying for a quarantine exemption varies depending on where you were vaccinated and the purpose of your travel. <br>
Most quarantine exemptions are currently suspended to control the spread of the omicron variant, regardless of your nationality or vaccination status. If you arrive in South Korea without a valid quarantine exemption you will need to quarantine for seven days. <br>
Quarantine exemptions will continue to be issued only if you are resident outside of South Korea, only for a visit lasting 14 days or less, and only for business and academic travellers, government officials, or if you are travelling to Korea for the funeral of a close family member. You can apply for a quarantine exemption via the Korean Embassy in the country where you were vaccinated. “Family member” is defined as your spouse, a sibling of you or your spouse, or a “lineal” family member (parents/grandparents or children/grandchildren) of you or your spouse. South Korea does not accept marriage certificates or civil partnership documents between same-sex partners for the purposes of applying for a quarantine exemption. If you are travelling for business or academic purposes, you need to obtain special approval from the relevant Korean ministries; if you are travelling for business, your employer can apply through the<a href=""http://www.btsc.or.kr/""> Business Support Centre</a> (in Korean). <br>
Even if you have a quarantine exemption, on arrival in Korea you will need to submit a negative PCR test taken within the 48 hours prior to your departure (with some exceptions, see ‘Testing on arrival’ above). You will be taken to an airport testing centre for your PCR test on arrival and will not be able to leave until the result has been received. You will need to do antigen tests on days three and five and a PCR test on day seven, and comply with active health monitoring through the Korean government app. <br>
Quarantine is mandatory if you do not have a quarantine exemption. Korean nationals and long-term foreign visitors with an Alien Registration Card and Korean residence may self-quarantine at home for seven days. <br>
Foreign short-term travellers may be able to quarantine with family members under specific circumstances. Your family member must be your spouse or a direct ascendent or descendent (a parent/grandparent or a child/grandchild, not a sibling) and must be resident in Korea (i.e. a Korean national or a foreigner with a long-term stay visa). You must be able to prove your family relationship, for example by showing your ID, a copy of your family member’s Korean ID, and a marriage or birth certificate, which must be legalised (or “apostilled”). Certified translations are required for documents not in English.) Your family’s accommodation must meet certain basic standards (typically, they must have a separate bedroom and a separate bathroom for you). Your family must also be available to pick you up from the airport or the quarantine facility. These rules may change at short notice – your family member in Korea should double-check the rules before you travel by calling the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency on 1339 (support is available in English). <br>
All other foreign short-term travellers must quarantine at a government-designated facility for seven days. Individuals are required to pay a daily charge of around 120,000KRW while in government quarantine facilities. <br>
If you test positive for COVID-19 on arrival, you must comply with self-quarantine and treatment instructions issued by the Korean authorities. See For more information contact the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency on 1339 from inside South Korea (support is available in English). <br>
*Onward travel from the airport: If you are required to quarantine at a government-designated facility, transport to the facility (usually a bus) will be provided. You will be guided to the transport by airport officials as part of your arrivals process. If you are a short-term visitor quarantining with family members, your family members must pick you up from the airport or from a quarantine facility later. (You will likely not be able to choose which facility you are sent to, so will not be able to pick one that is convenient for pickup.) If you are a short-term visitor with a quarantine exemption, you will need to proceed from the airport to the location where you will be staying using quarantine transport (see below). If you are resident in Korea and able to quarantine at home, you will be expected to make your way home using either your own car or quarantine transport options (see below). Quarantine transport options are available from the airport. Quarantine taxis can take you door-to-door. Quarantine buses run from the airport to locations around Seoul, from which you can take a quarantine taxi to your final destination. There are also quarantine KTX (bullet train) options if you live outside of Seoul; a quarantine bus will take you from the airport to Gwangmyeong KTX station. Once you reach your destination KTX station, you will be assisted to take a quarantine taxi to your final destination. Guidance is available at the airport on how best to proceed to your destination. <br>
*Demonstrating your COVID-19 status: For the purposes of applying for an exemption from quarantine, the Embassy of the Republic of Korea in London will accept the proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
*Data collection: All arrivals will be tested for COVID-19 on arrival, and will need to participate with an active monitoring system via regular calls with a health expert and a specialised mobile app. <br>
Make sure you have with you a mobile telephone with the roaming function enabled, and/or the telephone number of a friend, relative or contact who can update the authorities daily on your state of health. A hotel telephone number will not be accepted. Immigration authorities will undertake a test call before travellers leave the airport, and any individual unable to verify their contact details may be denied entry to South Korea. <br>
During your quarantine period, the location of your mobile phone will be tracked, and you will be contacted if you leave the place where you are quarantining.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Testing positive for COVID-19: If you think you might have COVID-19 while in South Korea, you should self-isolate immediately and contact the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency on 1339 for guidance (support is available in English). Outdoor sites where you can receive a free test are common in most cities. If you are eligible to receive a PCR test, you will usually receive your results via text message within 1-2 days. If you are not eligible to receive a PCR test, you will receive an antigen test which provides results within approximately 30 minutes. <br>
If you test positive for COVID-19, you must comply with self-quarantine and treatment instructions issued by the Korean authorities. If you have no or mild symptoms you will generally be eligible for quarantine and treatment at home, unless you suffer from certain medical conditions or are unable to sufficiently isolate from others. If the Korean authorities judge it necessary, you will be moved to a quarantine centre or a hospital/treatment centre. There is currently no charge for quarantine centre stays or for medical care in a hospital/treatment centre as long as you have not violated any quarantine measures. <br>
Fully vaccinated individuals will generally need to quarantine (whether at home or in a facility) for seven days. However, some individuals testing positive have, in the past, spent over a month in hospital/ treatment centres before testing negative and being discharged. Korean health authorities generally have broad discretion to apply the rules as they see fit. You may face additional costs from your travel provider if you have to rearrange your travel. <br>
Anyone displaying symptoms or returning a positive test result for COVID-19 must comply with self-quarantine and treatment instructions issued by the Korean authorities. Failure to do so could result in imprisonment, deportation, the revocation of visas or residence permits and an entry ban, and you may be held liable for the cost of your treatment and for any economic losses incurred by further transmission of the virus. The Ministry of Justice has made clear that this policy applies to foreign residents as well as short-term visitors. <br>
*Public spaces and services: Face masks are compulsory in public places and on public transport. Failure to wear a mask can result in a fine of up to 100,000 Korean. <br>

 International Restrictions: <br>
*Entry using the Vaccinated Travel Lane: Vaccinated travellers can enter Singapore from some countries without the need to quarantine by using a Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) flight. <br>
Land entry from Malaysia on VTL buses is currently only open to Malaysian and Singaporean citizens. There are specific guidelines and documents needed for travel to Singapore on a VTL flight. <br>
Read the <a href=""https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/vtl/requirements-and-process"">VTL pages on SafeTravel</a>, including the checklists and FAQs, very carefully before submitting an application. <br>
You must be fully vaccinated and have a <a href=""https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/vtl/faq#QRcode"">valid proof of vaccination</a>.
Those aged 12 to 15 years old who have received only one dose are not recognised as vaccinated by Singapore. They cannot travel on a Vaccinated Travel Lane flight. <br>
Make sure that you are booked on a VTL flight. If you’re issued a Vaccinated Travel Pass but arrive on a non-VTL flight, you may be denied entry. Travel insurance with a minimum coverage of S$30,000 is required. You can get this from an insurance provider of your choice or one of those<a href=""https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/health/insurance-and-treatment#insurance""> listed on the SafeTravel website</a>.
Before you travel, make sure to have hard copies of all documents found on the <a href=""https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/vtl/travel-checklist"">VTL Checklist</a>. Remember to get a PCR test or professionally administered Antigen Rapid Test (ART) within two days before your flight to Singapore. <br>
You’ll need to take these tests in Singapore: <br>
•        an on-arrival PCR test at Changi Airport – advance booking and payment required ARTs (self-administered) on Days 2-7 after arrival if you plan to leave your place of residence at any point during that day. Here’s a <a href=""https://www.hsa.gov.sg/consumer-safety/articles/covid19_selftests"">list of self-test kits authorised for use in Singapore</a>.
If you are fully vaccinated and recovered from COVID-19 (certified positive between 7-90 days before departure) and have documentary proof of this you may be eligible for a waiver of all border measures upon arrival in Singapore. You can use the <a href=""https://www.checkfirst.gov.sg/c/527f7439-ec71-4505-b243-ed978c18bd21"">self-check tool</a> to confirm eligibility. <br>
If you test positive for COVID-19, you will initially be required to isolate at your hotel or residential accommodation. Instructions on what to do next depend on whether you are well or unwell. Details can be found <a href=""https://www.covid.gov.sg/"">here</a>.

Internal restrictions: <br>
*Travel in Ukraine: Domestic flights are operating, although some carriers are operating a reduced schedule. Public transport in cities and bus and train travel between regions are also operating on a reduced scale. You require a vaccine certificate or negative PCR or express-test taken within 72 hours of travel, if travelling inter-city (by train, bus or plane) to or from a “yellow”, “orange” or “red” zone. <br>
*Quarantine measures: Coronavirus measures are in place until 31 March 2022, but may be extended further. Ukraine is operating a colour-coded adaptive quarantine system on a regional (oblasts and Kyiv city) basis. Quarantine measures may be imposed, and change, at short notice.

Failure to comply with restrictions may result in a fine or, in more serious cases, a prison sentence. Before taking public transport, you should consider whether you will be able to maintain social distancing. In regions classified as “green” zones, there are minimal restrictions beyond mask-wearing and distancing. <br>
In “yellow” and “orange” zones, mass events are prohibited unless all staff and participants have one of the following: a certificate of full vaccination (within the last 365 days), a certificate of recovery from Covid-19 (within the last 105 days) or a certificate of a negative PCR or rapid-antigen test (within the last 72 hours). The same restrictions apply to the opening of indoor hospitality venues, entertainment and cultural institutions, fitness centres and swimming pools, hostels and guesthouses. <br>
In “red” zones, these measures additionally apply to shopping malls and non-essential retail. Supermarkets and other grocery stores, pharmacies, veterinary supplies shops, banks and petrol stations remain open, as well as parks and public spaces. <br>
Ukraine will accept the proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
*Accommodation: Hotel accommodation remains open under the present quarantine rules, but hostels may only open in yellow, orange or red zones if all staff and customers are vaccinated. Hotel restaurant facilities are subject to the same rules as other restaurants, and will require a vaccinate certificate or negative Covid test for all customers. When staying in a hotel, you must adhere to the overall rules regarding masks and minimum distancing. If possible, check in online in advance to avoid check-in queues at the hotel. <br>

*All travellers: You will need to get a visa or an Electronic System for Travel Authorisation (ESTA) visa waiver to enter or transit the USA as a visitor. You should consult the <a href=""https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas.html"">US State Department website</a>
 to determine which you will need. <br>
You should be aware that if you have travelled to or have been in Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen on or after 1 March 2011, you are normally not eligible for an ESTA visa waiver and will need to apply for a US visa. <br>
*If you’re fully vaccinated: Most fully vaccinated foreign citizens can enter the USA. The US authorities will accept any COVID-19 vaccine approved for emergency use by the World Health Organisation or approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These are the AstraZeneca, BIBP/Sinopharm, Covishield, Janssen, Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech and Sinovac vaccines. In addition, those who have received the full series of an active (not placebo) COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca or Novavax COVID-19 vaccine trials are considered vaccinated. More details are on the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/noncitizens-US-air-travel.html"">US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>. Forign nationals planning to travel to the USA should familiarise themselves with the new requirements on the CDC website before booking any travel. <br>

Before boarding a flight to the USA, most passengers - regardless of vaccination status - are required to show a negative COVID-19 test result taken no more than 1 day before travel. All air passengers to the USA are also required to provide contact information to their airlines before boarding. You should check with your airline before you travel for more details. Full requirements for pre-travel testing can be found on the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/noncitizens-US-air-travel.html"">CDC website</a>.

You should check the list frequently as it is likely to change, sometimes daily, as rates of COVID-19 transmission increase or decrease. You must wear a mask on aircraft, trains, buses and at airports.<br>
*Proof of vaccination status: The USA will accept proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to travel. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.<br>

This also includes the European Union Digital COVID Certificate. Other accepted methods of proof include a printout of a COVID-19 vaccination record or a COVID-19 vaccination certificate issued at national or subnational level or by an authorized vaccine provider. Alternatively, digital photos of a vaccination card or record, a downloaded vaccine record or a vaccination certificate from an official source (e.g. public health agency, government agency, or other authorised vaccine provider), or a mobile phone application without a QR code. All forms of COVID-19 status must have a personal identifier, at a minimum including full name and date of birth, that match the information on a passenger’s passport or other travel documents. It must also include the name of the official source issuing the record and the vaccine manufacturer and date(s) of vaccination.<br>

Children 17 and under who are not fully vaccinated are exempt from the quarantine requirement after arrival in the US but must take a test 3 to 5 days after arrival and should self-isolate should any symptoms develop or if they test positive. <br>
If a child is not fully vaccinated and traveling alone or with adults who are not fully vaccinated, they will have to show proof of a negative viral test from a sample taken within one day of departure. <br>
If a child (17 and under) is travelling with only one parent or someone who isn’t a parent or legal guardian, you may be asked to provide certain documents at the border.

<br>
Internal Restrictions: <br>
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported to ""avoid travel"" to Azerbaijan, Belarus, Comoros, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and South Korea because of COVID-19. If you must travel, make sure you are fully vaccinated.<br>
Given what we [the CDC] currently know about COVID-19 and the Omicron variant, CDC is shortening the recommended time for isolation from 10 days for people with COVID-19 to five days, if asymptomatic, followed by five days of wearing a mask when around others. Additionally, CDC is updating the recommended quarantine period for those exposed to COVID-19. For people who are unvaccinated or are more than six months out from their second mRNA dose (or more than two months after the J&J vaccine) and not yet boosted, CDC now recommends quarantine for five days followed by strict mask use for an additional five days. Alternatively, if a five-day quarantine is not feasible, it is imperative that an exposed person wear a well-fitting mask at all times when around others for 10 days after exposure. Individuals who have received their booster shot do not need to quarantine following an exposure, but should wear a mask for 10 days after the exposure. For all those exposed, best practice would also include a test for SARS-CoV-2 at day five after exposure. If symptoms occur, individuals should immediately quarantine until a negative test confirms symptoms are not attributable to COVID-19.<br>
.*Travel in USA: Many airports in the USA have implemented safety measures designed to limit the spread of COVID-19. You should check the website of the airport you are flying into or transiting to see how these could affect you. <br>
On 21 January 2021 President Biden signed an Executive Order requiring masks to be worn on airplanes, trains, buses and at airports. <br>
Some states have rules in place requiring travellers from other states, with high rates of COVID-19, to quarantine or to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test. Before travelling you should check the websites of the relevant state governments. Further information can be found on the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/publichealthgateway/healthdirectories/healthdepartments.html"">CDC website</a>.
A number of US states have mandated the use of masks and face coverings while in public. These will vary from state to state and there can often be different rules within different localities in the same state. You should consult the website of the state or city to which you are travelling. Further details are found on the <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/states-and-territories"">US.GOV site</a>. Penalties for breaches of regulations will vary between each state and may sometimes vary in different areas in the same state. <br>
Some areas require proof of vaccination in order to access local amenities. In certain localities, children 17 and under may not be exempt from this requirement. With rising COVID cases across the country, many private venues, including restaurants and concert halls, are making proof of vaccination (or a recent negative COVID-19 test result) a requirement for entry. The precise requirements may vary from venue to venue so you should check on compliancy requirements in advance. <br>
*Accommodation: Hotels will be operating at capacities dictated by local rules and regulations. <br>
*Public places and services: Local regulations on shops, restaurants, bars, beaches and other leisure activities may be following measures designed to limit the spread of COVID-19. Some areas require proof of vaccination or evidence of a negative COVID-19 test in order to access local amenities. In certain localities, children 17 and under may not be exempt from this requirement. <br>
You should be aware that public places likely to attract large crowds may be closed at short notice. You should follow local media and any guidance issued by local authorities. <br>
On 9 September 2021 President Biden announced details of a 6-pronged national COVID-19 action plan. This includes requiring all employers with over 100 employees to ensure their workers are vaccinated or tested weekly. You can find details and requirements of the White House COVID-19 plan on the <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/covidplan/"">White House website</a>.
*If you test positive while in the USA you will be required to quarantine in a private area, likely a hotel or private residence. The length of time will depend on the guidance in the state where you are residing. This applies to those under 18 as well. You may also be contacted by local authorities to advise to isolate if you were in close contact with someone else who tested positive. Any assistance for those required to isolate will depend on the local authority. You should check the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-planner/index.html"">travel planner </a>to verify local state guidance.

If you are not fully vaccinated or are travelling with unvaccinated children you must self-isolate for 7 days and have tests on days 3 and 7 and then self-monitor for 14 days. <br>
These rules are liable to change. Check with local authorities / your travel operator before you travel. Some airlines are also instructing passengers to have a quick COVID test within 24 hours of their flight and there may be additional requirements for transiting passengers. <br>
Vietnam has suspended visa waivers, issuing of visas and the entry into Vietnam for all foreign nationals. There are a very small number of exceptions for diplomats on official business and certain high-skilled workers. These will be processed on a case by case basis. Such applications are required to be led by Vietnamese employers who must work directly through individual provincial government offices. The requirements and process may differ from province to province. The costs of quarantine, both in government centres and designated hotels, must be paid by those arriving or their employers. <br>
*Demonstrating your COVID-19 status: Fully vaccinated visitors to Vietnam with negative COVID-19 test results may be permitted to shorten their period of quarantine on entry at an assigned facility to 7 days, followed by another 7 days of medical surveillance at their residence. <br>
For those who have permission to travel, Vietnam will accept proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to travel, and no more than 12 months from the day of entry. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. For further information on entry requirements for those visiting Vietnam, visit the Vietnam Embassy website. <br>
*Land borders: Borders with China, Cambodia and Laos are currently closed except for the import and export of goods and returning Vietnamese nationals. <br>
*Transiting Vietnam: Currently transit in Vietnam is not allowed. <br>
*Data collection: Those arriving in Vietnam are required to provide information about recent travel. <br>
*Testing on departure: There is no requirement for testing on departure though anyone who has tested positive previously may be asked to show their negative test results and release certificates and airlines may require a negative test certificate to board. <br>
*Quarantine requirements on arrival: Quarantine is mandatory for anyone coming to Vietnam or who may have come in to contact with coronavirus inside. There are provisions for people who are exceptionally allowed to enter the country for work to be allowed to undertake quarantine in a hotel approved by the Ministry of Health. This is not guaranteed, is time consuming and must be arranged by your employer in Vietnam before you enter Vietnam. <br>
The Vietnamese government has confirmed that anyone entering Vietnam from 1 September 2020 must pay for quarantine costs both in government centres and in designated hotels. You will also be responsible for paying for any coronavirus hospital treatment costs. <br>
Vietnam’s quarantine requirements are mandated by the Vietnamese Ministry of Health. The British Embassy and Consulate General are unable to intervene in having these requirements waived, shortened or changed or assist in the reservation of, or transfer to, hotels used for quarantine. Violations carry strict penalties. <br>
You should expect to go into quarantine for at least 14 days. Fully vaccinated visitors may be permitted to leave after 7 days with a further 7 days at a place of residence. Quarantine will be longer if you test positive at any point. If you test positive, you should expect to be treated in a Vietnamese hospital. Asymptomatic patients may be discharged from hospital after 10 days and have 2 back to back negative COVID-19 tests. Once discharged you will be expected to undertake a period of self-isolation for 14 days and should follow the instructions issued by the local authorities. You should expect to be tested at least 3 times prior to release, and will be required to produce at least 2 consecutive negative tests during quarantine and may require further negative tests during self-isolation. <br>
Once you have completed quarantine and self-isolation you should receive a document specifying this. You should keep this, as you may need to present it customs/airport officials when you leave Vietnam. For information on self-isolation and quarantine measures if you come into contact with COVID-19 whilst in Vietnam please see the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/vietnam/coronavirus"">Coronavirus page</a>. <br>
