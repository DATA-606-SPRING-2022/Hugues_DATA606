## Project Proposal (Draft): Analysis of the influence of traveling restrictions on COVID-19

Since March 2020, COVID-19 was declared as a global pandemic. As of today, the COVID-19 infections are over 400 millions cases, and the death cases approches near 8 millions worldwide. Several countries have imposed travel restrictions in order to minimize the coronavirus disease infections. Major health organizations have taken some measures to prevent the spread of the virus, such as mandatory vaccines, negative testing results and masks wearing required for all the passengers. There was a period where some countries have suspended flights, but later after the lift of lockdowns, traveling has continued under certain restrictions to reduce the virus transmission.

My goal is to perform an analysis of the influence of traveling restrictions on COVID-19
by looking the correlation of traveling restrictions relative to the number of COVID-19 infections, deaths, recovery cases. My unit of analysis will primarly focus on domestic travels in the US, and if time permits I will explore other international travels. Therefore, I will be collecting the datasets from the reliable sources like Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), John Hopkins University Center for Systems Since and Engineering (JHU CSSE), and World Health Organization (WHO) as well as other traveling datasets from data.world. I plan to develop interesting visualizations of the relationships and apply Machine Learning techniques, such as Clustering.
